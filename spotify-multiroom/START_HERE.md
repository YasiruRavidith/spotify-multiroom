## 🎯 What Each Component Does

### Backend Server (`backend/server.js`)
```
Responsibilities:
├─ Stores your Spotify Premium credentials securely
├─ Handles OAuth authentication with Spotify
├─ Provides access tokens to frontend
├─ Manages WebSocket connections for sync
├─ Validates passwords (if enabled)
└─ Registers the virtual Spotify device

Endpoints:
├─ GET  /api/token              → Provides Spotify access token
├─ POST /api/register-device    → Registers device ID
├─ POST /api/transfer-playback  → Transfers playback to device
├─ POST /api/verify             → Verifies password
├─ GET  /auth/url               → Authorization URL
└─ GET  /callback               → OAuth callback
```

### Frontend App (`frontend/src/App.jsx`)
```
Features:
├─ Password protection screen (optional)
├─ Spotify Web Playback SDK initialization
├─ Real-time playback state display
├─ Album artwork and track information
├─ Progress bar with time tracking
├─ WebSocket client for synchronization
├─ Device status indicators
└─ Responsive, beautiful UI
```

## 🔄 How Everything Works Together

```
1. USER VISITS SITE
   ↓
2. ENTERS PASSWORD (if enabled)
   ↓
3. FRONTEND loads Spotify Web Playback SDK
   ↓
4. SDK requests TOKEN from BACKEND
   ↓
5. BACKEND uses refresh token → gets access token → returns to frontend
   ↓
6. SDK creates VIRTUAL SPOTIFY DEVICE
   ↓
7. DEVICE appears in Spotify app's device list
   ↓
8. USER selects device from Spotify app
   ↓
9. SPOTIFY streams music to all connected browsers
   ↓
10. WEBSOCKET syncs playback state across all devices
```
